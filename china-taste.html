                <p>
                    As one of my hometown's go-to Chinese takeout restaurants, 
                    I thought they were in need and deserving of a redesign.

                <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Context</h2>
                <p>
                    As a part of a UI/UX course, we were tasked with using responsive design 
                    principles to redesign a site in need of a redesign. As such, I chose China Taste's website to redesign.
                    <br/>
                    China Taste is a restaurant that is frequented in my hometown. As such, 
                    it's important that they have an accessible and usable website for people
                    to order food, view their menu, and find other information. However, as you'll 
                    see in the next section, this isn't the case, and the website is often 
                    unusable in certain circumstances.

                <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Research: Identifying Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    Using Usability Concepts as a basis for critiques, I identified the following 
                    problems with the current interface: 
                </p>
                <div class="card-critique" style="width: 100%">
                    <div class = "critique-photo-holder">
                        <img class = "critique-photo" src = "china-assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 2.57.35 AM.png" >
                    </div>
                   
                    <div class="critique-body">
                        <h3 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 32px;">Usability</h3>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Overall, the layout is quite unconventional:
                        <li>The ordering interface is embedded in a component</li>
                        <li>The ordering interface does not show you what's in the cart</li>
                        <li>the ordering interface has unintuitive flows</li>
                        <li>the ordering intercae is hard to navigate.</li>
                      </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="card-critique" style="width: 100%">
                    <div class = "critique-photo-holder">
                        <img class = "critique-photo" src = "china-assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 3.19.13 AM.png" >
                    </div>
                   
                    <div class="critique-body">
                        <h3 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 32px;">Learnability and Memorability</h3>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        The menu interface requires relearning:
                        <li>There are over 22 menu categories</li>
                        <li>There is no order or organization of categories</li>
                        <li>3-4 Clicks are required to add a single item to cart</li>
                        <li>Log-in required for checkout</li>
                      </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    The key component that is unusable-and therefore confusing-is the menu/ordering interface. The other 
                    information/components are all unconventional, but very easy to learn. 
                </p>

                <h3 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px;">Stakeholders</h3>
                <p>
                    The main stakeholders are (1) new customers and (2) returning customers. 
                    Both groups, however, require the same key information to use the interface
                    as intended: menu and ordering. As such, I focused on redesigning the 
                    ordering/menu interface.
                </p>
                
                <br></br>
                <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Design Choices</h2>
                <h3 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 30px;">Responsivenes</h3>
                <p>
                    These low-fi wireframes outline how I made the interface responsive across desktop and mobile interfaces. In summary, 
                    I opted to use a collapsible navbar, along with flex wrapping to ensure that the mobile screen coudl fit all of the 
                    components featuredon the desktop.

                <p>
                    In executing this redesign, we were limited to one page, so I was unable to fully redesign the about, hours, and reviews pages.
                    In addition, if I were to redesign the entire site, I would move the ordering interface to a completely different page to declutter
                    the home page.

                <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Conclusions:</h2>
                <p>
                    I found this project to be especially challenging with it being my first time using Bootstrap. On the flip side, however,
                    this project was extremely rewarding because it walked me through the entire design process from identifying problems, all the way 
                    to implementation. The most valuable lesson from this project was the reinforcement of good design principles; it was 
                    really interesting to actually critique poor design and improve upon it myself.
