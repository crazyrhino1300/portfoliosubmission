                Marketed as a multi-purpose tutor business management platform, Koala

            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Context</h2>
            <p>
                At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, teachers and students
                across the country were forced to shift to a totally virtual 
                classroom setting. Hosted through  Zoom, Google Meets, 
                and other video conferencing applications, these 'classrooms' lacked
                the interaction neccessary to engage students for long periods of time.
                <br></br>
                As virtual teaching has become a norm, however, there remains the problem of: 
                "how can we design a platform an online platform that engages students more effectively
                than traditional video conferencing platforms?"
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Research and Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                Building off of Koala's (YC W22) concept, I designed and all-inclusive
                platform with the capability to engage students through games. 
            </p>

            <br></br>
            <p>
                Koala's overarching goals are to (1) create a video-conferencing
                that engages students through educational videogames and (2) create 
                an all-inclusive interface for tutors, students and parents to execute
                all necessary actions such as scheduling, joining meetings, and paying 
                tutors.
                <br></br>
                Given the novelty of the idea, we drew primarily on our experiences from 
                playing games like webkinz, coolmath, poptropica, and other 
                games to create an engaging and intuitive platform for students, 
                educators, and parents.

            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">User Testing</h2>
            <p>
                We asked testers to pretend that they were Koala online tutors, tasked with running 
                their business through Koala. We tasked our testers with navigating through 
                the interface and executing  crucial day-to-day tasks: logging in, starting a meeting, checking schedules, and preparing for upcoming sessions. All three 
                testers performed in line with our expectations and completed the overarching task under 9 minutes while providing verbal feedback 
                for further improvement on our interface. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h4 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 32px;">Test Summary</h4>
            <p>
                Overall, the testers had little to no difficulty navigating the interface and landing on the directed pages. 
                They also verbally communicated that they didnâ€™t find the tasks difficult but were mainly confused about gaps in the interactive 
                interface. 
            </p>
            <h4 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 32px;">Potential Changes</h4>
            <p>
                After reviewing the testers' videos, we considered changing the tutor's 'launch meeting' button to be 
                nested under each of their students on their home screen. This would decrease any confusion about 
                which session they were starting. 
            <p></p>
            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, this was a challenging but really rewarding project to be a part of. 
                As students who have experienced the online classroom, this is a concept that I wish
                I had; it would have made high school during the pandemic a little more enjoyable. 
                In terms of takeaways, it was really insightful to walk through the entire
                design process, analyzing all of the stakeholders, and adapting to those groups.
                This was a deeply empathetic and thoughtful process whose experience I will carry in every
                design I do.
